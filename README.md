# EITfourlevel

This is some of the code to generate the plots on the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.12267.

This notebook is not friendly and there is absolutely no comment. I did not clean up, so it is also very repetitive. However, I feel that if anyone is interested in calculating EIT and knows what is going on, it should be helpful to a few people.

I have not included any data, and I could not upload some of the larger code because of the limit of the Github file size. 

Feel free to use it, just say hello to me!

Good work!
